## Introduction

The main project is a very basic Angular application which lists books and shows the details of a book.

## Business Requirements

* The books are displayed in a list format
* Each book displays its image, title, author(s), genre and number of votes
* The list is sortable by title and number of votes, ascending and descending
* The UI/UX should be consistent and coherent
* I use sample data from `src/assets/books.json`
* navigation between components is done using the routing module (single page application).
* The book services loads the books from the assets and creates a subject for delivering the books to the components
